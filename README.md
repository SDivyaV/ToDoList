# ToDoList
A very efficient to-do list where the user can add as many things he has to do in the day.
When the user finishes a particular job that is done the user can click on that task to mark down as done and a special message will be displayed so that the user is 
motivated to do all the tasks that were to be done.
This project is in ReactJs.
